              "  'On 10 November 2005 Airbus announced the A318 Elite  The Airbus A318 Elite is aimed at the medium range market for flights of up to 4 000 nautical mile  7 400 km  range  with a choice of two cabin layouts seating up to 18 passengers  and powered by CFM engines  Comlux Aviation became the launch customer by ordering three A318 Elite aircraft',\n",
              "  'In September 2010  Airbus confirmed that from 2013 the Airbus A318 would become available with Sharklets  wingtip devices which reduce lift induced drag and improve efficiency through reduced fuel consumption  The optional devices  which will also be available on other Airbus A320 family models and are manufactured by Korean Air Aerospace Division  will increase the range of the aircraft to 5 930 kilometres  3 200 nmi    an increase of 185 kilometres  100 nmi  over a standard A318 with 107 seats in a two class configuration',\n",
              "  'The Airbus A318 is a small commercial  narrow body  single aisle  aircraft with a retractable tricycle landing gear and is powered by two wing pylon mounted turbofan engines  Two suppliers provide turbofan engines for the A318  CFM International with the CFM56 5B engine and Pratt   Whitney with the PW6000 engine  It is a low wing cantilever monoplane with a conventional tail unit having a single vertical stabilizer and rudder',\n",
              "  'Overall  the A318 is over six metres shorter and around 3 t  6 600 lb  lighter than the A320  To compensate for the reduced moment arm  it has a larger vertical stabiliser  While initial concepts depicted the aircraft with a Boeing 737 300 style dorsal fin extension  the final design incorporated a fin tip extension  making it 75 centimetres  30 in  taller than the other A320 variants  Pilots who are trained on the other variants may fly the A318 with no further certification  since it features a common flight deck and the same type rating as its sister aircraft  The A318 is also referred to as the A318',\n",
              "  'The A318 is available with a variety of different maximum take off weights  MTOW  ranging from a 59 tonnes  58 long tons  65 short tons  2 750 kilometres  1 480 nmi  base model to a 68 tonnes  67 long tons  75 short tons  6 000 kilometres  3 200 nmi  version  When equipped with CFM56 5B8 P engines  the A318 is available with a 123 000 lb  MTOW or a 150 000 lb  MTOW  When equipped with CFM56 5B9 P engines  the A318 is available with a 130 000 lb  MTOW or a 150 000 lb  MTOW  The lower MTOW enables it to operate regional routes economically while sacrificing range and the higher MTOW allows it to complement other members of the A320 family on marginal routes  The lighter weight of the A318 gives it an operating range 10  greater than the A320  allowing it to serve some routes that the A320 would be unable to  London   New York  Perth Auckland and Singapore Tokyo  for instance  Its main use for airlines  however  is on short  low density hops between medium sized cities',\n",
              "  'In March 2006  the European Aviation Safety Agency  EASA  certified a modified control software enhancement to the Airbus A318 designed to allow the aircraft to perform steep approaches  The aircraft is the largest commercial aircraft certified by EASA for steep approach operations  The software modifies the control laws of the aircraft when the steep approach function is selected by the crew  by automatically deploying some of the spoiler panels to provide additional drag when the aircraft is in the landing configuration  It also provides alternative aural alerts to the crew and modifies spoiler deployment automatically below 120 feet  37 m  on landing  The A318 steep approach procedure allows the aircraft to perform approaches at descent angles of up to 5 5  as opposed to the standard 3  for a normal approach',\n",
              "  'A test flight was conducted in May 2006 to prove the aircraft s steep approach and short runway performance by landing at London City Airport  where such steep approaches are required  The test flight also confirmed the aircraft s compatibility with the limited manoeuvring and parking space at that airport  Subsequently  in August  Airbus delivered the first A318 with steep approach capability to British Airways  which began operating the route the following month  eventually having two such aircraft capable of flights between London City Airport and John F  Kennedy International Airport in New York  On the westbound leg from London  a stopover is necessary for refueling  which occurs at Shannon Airport  Ireland because weight restrictions are necessary in order to take off within the existing short runway length of London City Airport  On the eastbound leg from New York this limitation is not present and the aircraft can take all the fuel needed for the transatlantic route to London  As of November 2017  only one aircraft is serving the route  operated in a 32 seat all business class configuration',\n",
              "  'Although final assembly of A320 family aircraft takes place in Toulouse  France  Hamburg  Germany  Tianjin  China  and Mobile  Alabama  USA  final assembly of the Airbus A318 was in Hamburg  Germany  The maiden flight of the Airbus A318 took place from Finkenwerder airfield in Hamburg on 15 January 2002  The first customer delivery was on 22 July 2003 to Frontier Airlines As of 30 September 2017  67 A318s remained in service with five airlines  in addition to governments  executive and private jets and undisclosed operators  Most A318 aircraft retired from airline service have been scrapped due to the engine and components being more valuable than whole aircraft  Frontier Airlines  the launch customer that acquired A318 aircraft between 2003 and 2007  had retired their last A318 by 2013']]"
