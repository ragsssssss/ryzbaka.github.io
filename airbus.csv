0,Aircraft,"['An aircraft is a vehicle that is able to fly by gaining support from the air  It counters the force of gravity by using either static lift or by using the dynamic lift of an airfoil  or in a few cases the downward thrust from jet engines  Common examples of aircraft include airplanes  helicopters  airships  including blimps  gliders  paramotors and hot air balloons', 'The human activity that surrounds aircraft is called aviation  The science of aviation  including designing and building aircraft  is called aeronautics  Crewed aircraft are flown by an onboard pilot  but unmanned aerial vehicles may be remotely controlled or self controlled by onboard computers  Aircraft may be classified by different criteria  such as lift type  aircraft propulsion  usage and others', 'A balloon was originally any aerostat  while the term airship was used for large  powered aircraft designs  usually fixed wing  In 1919 Frederick Handley Page was reported as referring to  ships of the air  with smaller passenger types as  Air yachts  In the 1930s  large intercontinental flying boats were also sometimes referred to as  ships of the air  or  flying ships  though none had yet been built  The advent of powered balloons  called dirigible balloons  and later of rigid hulls allowing a great increase in size  began to change the way these words were used  Huge powered aerostats  characterized by a rigid outer framework and separate aerodynamic skin surrounding the gas bags  were produced  the Zeppelins being the largest and most famous  There were still no fixed wing aircraft or non rigid balloons large enough to be called airships  so  airship  came to be synonymous with these aircraft  Then several accidents  such as the Hindenburg disaster in 1937  led to the demise of these airships  Nowadays a  balloon  is an unpowered aerostat and an  airship  is a powered one', 'A powered  steerable aerostat is called a dirigible  Sometimes this term is applied only to non rigid balloons  and sometimes dirigible balloon is regarded as the definition of an airship  which may then be rigid or non rigid  Non rigid dirigibles are characterized by a moderately aerodynamic gasbag with stabilizing fins at the back  These soon became known as blimps  During World War II  this shape was widely adopted for tethered balloons  in windy weather  this both reduces the strain on the tether and stabilizes the balloon  The nickname blimp was adopted along with the shape  In modern times  any small dirigible or airship is called a blimp  though a blimp may be unpowered as well as powered', 'Aerodynamic lift involving wings is the most common  with fixed wing aircraft being kept in the air by the forward movement of wings  and rotorcraft by spinning wing shaped rotors sometimes called rotary wings  A wing is a flat  horizontal surface  usually shaped in cross section as an aerofoil  To fly  air must flow over the wing and generate lift  A flexible wing is a wing made of fabric or thin sheet material  often stretched over a rigid frame  A kite is tethered to the ground and relies on the speed of the wind over its wings  which may be flexible or rigid  fixed  or rotary', 'Compound rotorcraft have wings that provide some or all of the lift in forward flight  They are nowadays classified as powered lift types and not as rotorcraft  Tiltrotor aircraft  such as the Bell Boeing V 22 Osprey  tiltwing  tail sitter  and coleopter aircraft have their rotors propellers horizontal for vertical flight and vertical for forward flight', 'The largest aircraft by weight and largest regular fixed wing aircraft ever built  as of  is the Antonov An 225 Mriya  That Ukrainian built six engine Russian transport of the 1980s is 84 meters  276 feet  long  with an 88 meter  289 foot  wingspan  It holds the world payload record  after transporting 428 834 pounds  200 tons  of goods  and has recently flown 100 ton loads commercially  Weighing in at somewhere between 1 1 and 1 4 million pounds  550 700 tons  maximum loaded weight  it is also the heaviest aircraft to be built  to date  It can cruise at 500 mph', 'The largest military airplanes are the Ukrainian Russian Antonov An 124 Ruslan  world s second largest airplane  also used as a civilian transport  and American Lockheed C 5 Galaxy transport  weighing  loaded  over 765 000 pounds  over

airplanes  apart from the above noted An 225 and An 124  are the Airbus Beluga cargo transport derivative of the Airbus A300 jet airliner  the Boeing Dreamlifter cargo transport derivative of the Boeing 747 jet airliner transport  the 747 200B was  at its creation in the 1960s  the heaviest aircraft ever built  with a maximum weight of 836 000 pounds  over 400 tons  and the double decker Airbus A380  super jumbo  jet airliner  the world s largest passenger airliner', 'The fastest recorded powered aircraft flight and fastest recorded aircraft flight of an air breathing powered aircraft was of the NASA X 43A Pegasus  a scramjet powered  hypersonic  lifting body experimental research aircraft  at Mach 9 6  nearly 7 000 mph  The X 43A set that new mark  and broke its own world record of Mach 6 3  nearly 5 000 mph  set in March 2004  on its third and final flight on 16 November 2004', 'Prior to the X 43A  the fastest recorded powered airplane flight  and still the record for the

flight it reached an altitude of 354 300 feet', 'Gliders are heavier than air aircraft that do not employ propulsion once airborne  Take off may be by launching forward and downward from a high location  or by pulling into the air on a tow line  either by a ground based winch or vehicle  or by a powered  tug  aircraft  For a glider to maintain its forward air speed and lift  it must descend in relation to the air  but not necessarily in relation to the ground  Many gliders can  soar  i e  gain height from updrafts such as thermal currents  The first practical  controllable example was designed and built by the British scientist and pioneer George Cayley  whom many recognise as the first aeronautical engineer  Common examples of gliders are sailplanes  hang gliders and paragliders', 'Powered aircraft have one or more onboard sources of mechanical power  typically aircraft engines although rubber and manpower have also been used  Most aircraft engines are either lightweight reciprocating engines or gas turbines  Engine fuel is stored in tanks  usually in the wings but larger aircraft also have additional fuel tanks in the fuselage', 'Propeller aircraft use one or more propellers  airscrews  to create thrust in a forward direction  The propeller is usually mounted in front of the power source in tractor configuration but can be mounted behind in pusher configuration  Variations of propeller layout include contra rotating propellers and ducted fans', 'Many kinds of power plant have been used to drive propellers  Early airships used man power or steam engines  The more practical internal combustion piston engine was used for virtually all fixed wing aircraft until World War II and is still used in many smaller aircraft  Some types use turbine engines to drive a propeller in the form of a turboprop or propfan  Human powered flight has been achieved  but has not become a practical means of transport  Unmanned aircraft and models have also used power sources such as electric motors and rubber bands', 'Turbojet and turbofan engines use a spinning turbine to drive one or more fans  which provide additional thrust  An afterburner may be used to inject extra fuel into the hot exhaust  especially on military  fast jets  Use of a turbine is not absolutely necessary  other designs include the pulsejet and ramjet  These mechanically simple designs cannot work when stationary  so the aircraft must be launched to flying speed by some other method  Other variants have also been used  including the motorjet and hybrids such as the Pratt   Whitney J58  which can convert between turbojet and ramjet operation', 'The approach to structural design varies widely between different types of aircraft  Some  such as paragliders  comprise only flexible materials that act in tension and rely on aerodynamic pressure to hold their shape  A balloon similarly relies on internal gas pressure  but may have a rigid basket or gondola slung below it to carry its payload  Early aircraft  including airships  often employed flexible doped aircraft fabric covering to give a reasonably smooth aeroshell stretched over a rigid frame  Later aircraft employed semi monocoque techniques  where the skin of the aircraft is stiff enough to share much of the flight loads  In a true monocoque design there is no internal structure left', 'Heavier than air types are characterised by one or more wings and a central fuselage  The fuselage typically also carries a tail or empennage for stability and control  and an undercarriage for takeoff and landing  Engines may be located on the fuselage or wings  On a fixed wing aircraft the wings are rigidly attached to the fuselage  while on a rotorcraft the wings are attached to a rotating vertical shaft  Smaller designs sometimes use flexible materials for part or all of the structure  held in place either by a rigid frame or by air pressure  The fixed parts of the structure comprise the airframe', 'The flight envelope of an aircraft refers to its approved design capabilities in terms of airspeed  load factor and altitude  The term can also refer to other assessments of aircraft performance such as maneuverability  When an aircraft is abused  for instance by diving it at too high a speed  it is said to be flown outside the envelope  something considered foolhardy since it has been taken beyond the design limits which have been established by the manufacturer  Going beyond the envelope may have a known outcome such as flutter or entry to a non recoverable spin  possible reasons for the boundary', 'Flight dynamics is the science of air vehicle orientation and control in three dimensions  The three critical flight dynamics parameters are the angles of rotation around three axes which pass through the vehicle s center of gravity  known as pitch  roll  and yaw', 'A fixed wing is typically unstable in  pitch  roll  and yaw  Pitch and yaw stabilities of conventional fixed wing designs require horizontal and vertical stabilisers  which act similarly to the feathers on an arrow  These stabilizing surfaces allow equilibrium of aerodynamic forces and to stabilise the flight dynamics of pitch and yaw  They are usually mounted on the tail section  empennage  although in the canard layout  the main aft wing replaces the canard foreplane as pitch stabilizer  Tandem wing and tailless aircraft rely on the same general rule to achieve stability  the aft surface being the stabilising one', 'Aerospace engineers develop control systems for a vehicle s orientation  attitude  about its center of mass  The control systems include actuators  which exert forces in various directions  and generate rotational forces or moments about the aerodynamic center of the aircraft  and thus rotate the aircraft in pitch  roll  or yaw  For example  a pitching moment is a vertical force applied at a distance forward or aft from the aerodynamic center of the aircraft  causing the aircraft to pitch up or down  Control systems are also sometimes used to increase or decrease drag  for example to slow the aircraft to a safe speed for landing', 'Aircraft permit long distance  high speed travel and may be a more fuel efficient mode of transportation in some circumstances  Aircraft have environmental and climate impacts beyond fuel efficiency considerations  however  They are also relatively noisy compared to other forms of travel and high altitude aircraft generate contrails  which experimental evidence suggests may alter weather patterns', 'Commercial aircraft include types designed for scheduled and charter airline flights  carrying passengers  mail and other cargo  The larger passenger carrying types are the airliners  the largest of which are wide body aircraft  Some of the smaller types are also used in general aviation  and some of the larger types are used as VIP aircraft', 'General aviation is a catch all covering other kinds of private  where the pilot is not paid for time or expenses  and commercial use  and involving a wide range of aircraft types such as business jets  bizjets  trainers  homebuilt  gliders  warbirds and hot air balloons to name a few  The vast majority of aircraft today are general aviation types']"
1,Powered aircraft,['The earliest designs used man power to give dirigible balloons some degree of control  and go back to Jean Pierre Blanchard in 1784  Attempts to achieve heavier than air man powered flight did not succeed fully until Paul MacCready s Gossamer Condor in 1977']
2,Lift (force),"['A fluid flowing around the surface of an object exerts a force on it  Lift is the component of this force that is perpendicular to the oncoming flow direction  It contrasts with the drag force  which is the component of the force parallel to the flow direction  Lift conventionally acts in an upward direction in order to counter the force of gravity  but it can act in any direction at right angles to the flow', 'A fluid flowing around the surface of an object applies a force against it  It makes no difference whether the fluid is flowing past a stationary body or the body is moving through a stationary volume of fluid  Lift is the component of this force that is perpendicular to the oncoming flow direction  Lift is always accompanied by a drag force  which is the component of the surface force parallel to the flow direction', 'Lift is mostly associated with the wings of fixed wing aircraft  although it is more widely generated by many other streamlined bodies such as propellers  kites  helicopter rotors  racing car wings  maritime sails  and wind turbines in air  and by sailboat keels  ship s rudders  and hydrofoils in water  Lift is also exploited by flying and gliding animals  especially by birds  bats  and insects  and even in the plant world by the seeds of certain trees', 'While the common meaning of the word  lift  assumes that lift opposes weight  lift can be in any direction with respect to gravity  since it is defined with respect to the direction of flow rather than to the direction of gravity  When an aircraft is cruising in straight and level flight  most of the lift opposes gravity  However  when an aircraft is climbing  descending  or banking in a turn the lift is tilted with respect to the vertical  Lift may also act as downforce in some aerobatic manoeuvres  or on the wing on a racing car  Lift may also be largely horizontal  for instance on a sailing ship', 'There are several ways to explain how an airfoil generates lift  Some are more complicated or more physically rigorous than others  some have been shown to be incorrect  For example  there are explanations based directly on Newton s laws of motion and explanations based on Bernoulli s principle  Either can be used to explain lift', 'However  there is no physical principle that requires equal transit time and experimental results show that this assumption is false  In fact  the air moving over the top of an airfoil generating lift moves much faster than the equal transit theory predicts  Further  the theory violates Newton s third law of motion  since it describes a force on the wing with no opposite force', 'In its original sense  the Coand  effect refers to the tendency of a fluid jet to stay attached to an adjacent surface that curves away from the flow  and the resultant entrainment of ambient air into the flow  The effect is named for Henri Coand  the Romanian aerodynamicist who exploited it in many of his patents', 'More broadly  some consider the effect to include the tendency of any fluid boundary layer to adhere to a curved surface  not just the boundary layer accompanying a fluid jet  It is in this broader sense that the Coand  effect is used by some to explain why airflow remains attached to the top side of an airfoil  Jef Raskin  for example  describes a simple demonstration  using a straw to blow over the upper surface of a wing  The wing deflects upwards  thus demonstrating that the Coand  effect creates lift  This demonstration correctly demonstrates the Coand  effect as a fluid jet  the exhaust from a straw  adhering to a curved surface  the wing  However  the upper surface in this flow is a complicated  vortex laden mixing layer  while on the lower surface the flow is quiescent  The physics of this demonstration are very different from that of the general flow over the wing  The usage in this sense is encountered in some popular references on aerodynamics  This is a controversial use of the term  Coand  effect  The more established view in the aerodynamics field is that the Coand  effect is defined in the more limited sense above  and the flow following the upper surface simply reflects an absence of boundary layer separation  thus it is not an example of the Coand  effect', 'No matter how smooth the surface of an airfoil seems  any surface is rough on the scale of air molecules  Air molecules flying into the surface bounce off the rough surface in random directions relative to their original velocities  The result is that when the air is viewed as a continuous material  it is seen to be unable to slide along the surface  and the air s velocity relative to the airfoil decreases to nearly zero at the surface  i e  the air molecules  stick  to the surface instead of sliding along it  something known as the no slip condition  Because the air at the surface has near zero velocity but the air away from the surface is moving  there is a thin boundary layer in which air close to the surface is subjected to a shearing motion  The air s viscosity resists the shearing  giving rise to a shear stress at the airfoil s surface called skin friction drag  Over most of the surface of most airfoils  the boundary layer is naturally turbulent  which increases skin friction drag', 'The flow around bluff bodies   i e  without a streamlined shape  or stalling airfoils   may also generate lift  in addition to a strong drag force  This lift may be steady  or it may oscillate due to vortex shedding  Interaction of the object s flexibility with the vortex shedding may enhance the effects of fluctuating lift and cause vortex induced vibrations  For instance  the flow around a circular cylinder generates a K rm n vortex street  vortices being shed in an alternating fashion from the cylinder s sides  The oscillatory nature of the flow produces a fluctuating lift force on the cylinder  even though the net  mean  force is negligible  The lift force frequency is characterised by the dimensionless Strouhal number  which depends on the Reynolds number of the flow', 'By using the streamwise vector i parallel to the freestream in place of k in the integral  we obtain an expression for the pressure drag Dp  which includes the pressure portion of the profile drag and  if the wing is three dimensional  the induced drag  If we use the spanwise vector j  we obtain the side force Y', 'In potential flow theory  the flow is assumed to be irrotational  i e  that small fluid parcels have no net rate of rotation  Mathematically  this is expressed by the statement that the curl of the velocity vector field is everywhere equal to zero  Irrotational flows have the convenient property that the velocity can be expressed as the gradient of a scalar function called a potential  A flow represented in this way is called potential flow', 'Applying potential flow theory to a lifting flow requires special treatment and an additional assumption  The problem arises because lift on an airfoil in inviscid flow requires circulation in the flow around the airfoil  See  Circulation and the Kutta Joukowski theorem  below  but a single potential function that is continuous throughout the domain around the airfoil cannot represent a flow with nonzero circulation  The solution to this problem is to introduce a branch cut  a curve or line from some point on the airfoil surface out to infinite distance  and to allow a jump in the value of the potential across the cut  The jump in the potential imposes circulation in the flow equal to the potential jump and thus allows nonzero circulation to be represented  However  the potential jump is a free parameter that is not determined by the potential equation or the other boundary conditions  and the solution is thus indeterminate  A potential flow solution exists for any value of the circulation and any value of the lift  One way to resolve this indeterminacy is to impose the Kutta condition  which is that  of all the possible solutions  the physically reasonable solution is the one in which the flow leaves the trailing edge smoothly  The streamline sketches illustrate one flow pattern with zero lift  in which the flow goes around the trailing edge and leaves the upper surface ahead of the trailing edge  and another flow pattern with positive lift  in which the flow leaves smoothly at the trailing edge in accordance with the Kutta condition', 'The Kutta Joukowski theorem relates the lift per unit width of span of a two dimensional airfoil to this circulation component of the flow  It is a key element in an explanation of lift that follows the development of the flow around an airfoil as the airfoil starts its motion from rest and a starting vortex is formed and left behind  leading to the formation of circulation around the airfoil  Lift is then inferred from the Kutta Joukowski theorem  This explanation is largely mathematical  and its general progression is based on logical inference  not physical cause and effect', 'For the free air case  no ground plane  the force  L displaystyle  L  exerted by the airfoil on the fluid is manifested partly as momentum fluxes and partly as pressure differences at the outer boundary  in proportions that depend on the shape of the outer boundary  as shown in the diagram at right  For a flat horizontal rectangle that is much longer than it is tall  the fluxes of vertical momentum through the front and back are negligible  and the lift is accounted for entirely by the integrated pressure differences on the top and bottom  For a square or circle  the momentum fluxes and pressure differences account for half the lift each  For a vertical rectangle that is much taller than it is wide  the unbalanced pressure forces on the top and bottom are negligible  and lift is accounted for entirely by momentum fluxes  with a flux of upward momentum that enters the control volume through the front accounting for half the lift  and a flux of downward momentum that exits the control volume through the back accounting for the other half']"
3,Helicopter,"['A helicopter  sometimes referred to in slang as a  chopper  or  helo   United States military usage  pronounced with a long  e  is a type of rotorcraft in which lift and thrust are supplied by horizontally spinning rotors  This allows the helicopter to take off and land vertically  to hover  and to fly forward  backward  and laterally  These attributes allow helicopters to be used in congested or isolated areas where fixed wing aircraft and many forms of VTOL  Vertical TakeOff and Landing  aircraft cannot perform', 'The English word helicopter is adapted from the French

helicopter in 1936  Some helicopters reached limited production  but it was not until 1942 that a helicopter designed by Igor Sikorsky reached full scale production  with 131 aircraft built  Though most earlier designs used more than one main rotor  it is the single main rotor with anti torque tail rotor configuration that has become the most common helicopter configuration   Tandem rotor helicopters are also in widespread use due to their greater payload capacity   Coaxial helicopters  tiltrotor aircraft  and compound helicopters are all flying today   Quadcopter helicopters were pioneered as early as 1907 in France  and other types of multicopter have been developed for specialized applications such as unmanned drones', 'Some helicopters use other anti torque controls instead of the tail rotor  such as the ducted fan  called Fenestron or FANTAIL  and NOTAR  NOTAR provides anti torque similar to the way a wing develops lift through the use of the Coand  effect on the tail boom', 'Some radio controlled helicopters and smaller  helicopter type unmanned aerial vehicles  use electric motors  Radio controlled helicopters may also have piston engines that use fuels other than gasoline  such as nitromethane  Some turbine engines commonly used in helicopters can also use biodiesel instead of jet fuel', 'Helicopter rotors are designed to operate in a narrow range of RPM  The throttle controls the power produced by the engine  which is connected to the rotor by a fixed ratio transmission  The purpose of the throttle is to maintain enough engine power to keep the rotor RPM within allowable limits so that the rotor produces enough lift for flight  In single engine helicopters  the throttle control is a motorcycle style twist grip mounted on the collective control  while dual engine helicopters have a power lever for each engine', 'A compound helicopter has an additional system for thrust and  typically  small stub fixed wings  This offloads the rotor in cruise  which allows its rotation to be slowed down  thus increasing the maximum speed of the aircraft  The Lockheed AH 56A Cheyenne diverted up to 90  of its engine power to a pusher propeller during forward flight', 'Due to the operating characteristics of the helicopter its ability to take off and land vertically  and to hover for extended periods of time  as well as the aircraft s handling properties under low airspeed conditions it has been chosen to conduct tasks that were previously not possible with other aircraft  or were time  or work intensive to accomplish on the ground  Today  helicopter uses include transportation of people and cargo  military uses  construction  firefighting  search and rescue  tourism  medical transport  law enforcement  agriculture  news and media  and aerial observation  among others They can be used for Reflection seismology or recreation', 'Helitack  is the use of helicopters to combat wildland fires  The helicopters are used for aerial firefighting  water bombing  and may be fitted with tanks or carry helibuckets  Helibuckets  such as the Bambi bucket  are usually filled by submerging the bucket into lakes  rivers  reservoirs  or portable tanks  Tanks fitted onto helicopters are filled from a hose while the helicopter is on the ground or water is siphoned from lakes or reservoirs through a hanging snorkel as the helicopter hovers over the water source  Helitack helicopters are also used to deliver firefighters  who rappel down to inaccessible areas  and to resupply firefighters  Common firefighting helicopters include variants of the

or cannot transport the patient to a medical facility in time  Helicopters are also used when patients need to be transported between medical facilities and air transportation is the most practical method  An air ambulance helicopter is equipped to stabilize and provide limited medical treatment to a patient while in flight  The use of helicopters as air ambulances is often referred to as  MEDEVAC  and patients are referred to as being  airlifted  or  medevaced  This use was pioneered in the Korean War  when time to reach a medical facility was reduced to three hours from the eight hours needed in World War II  and further reduced to two hours by the Vietnam War', 'Military forces use attack helicopters to conduct aerial attacks on ground targets  Such helicopters are mounted with missile launchers and miniguns  Transport helicopters are used to ferry troops and supplies where the lack of an airstrip would make transport via fixed wing aircraft impossible  The use of transport helicopters to deliver troops as an attack force on an objective is referred to as  air assault  Unmanned aerial systems  UAS  helicopter systems of varying sizes are developed by companies

contrarotating turkey flight  as rotor blades  and in 1784  demonstrated it to the French Academy of Sciences  Sir George Cayley  influenced by a childhood fascination with the Chinese flying top  developed a model of feathers  similar to that of Launoy and Bienvenu  but powered by rubber bands  By the end of the century  he had progressed to using sheets of tin for rotor blades and springs for power  His writings on his experiments and models would become influential on future aviation pioneers  Alphonse P naud would later develop coaxial rotor model helicopter toys in 1870  also powered by

known example of a quadcopter  Although there is some uncertainty about the date  sometime between 14 August and 29 September 1907  the Gyroplane No  1 lifted its pilot into the air about 0 6 metres  2 ft  for a minute  The Gyroplane No 1 proved to be extremely unsteady and required a man at each corner of the airframe to hold it steady  For this reason  the flights of the Gyroplane No 1 are considered to be the first manned flight of a helicopter  but not a free or untethered flight', 'That same year  fellow French inventor Paul Cornu designed and built the Cornu helicopter which used

 The designs were presented in 1992 and the most competitive designs were used 17 18 In January 1993  Boeing and several companies in the Airbus consortium started a joint feasibility study of a Very Large Commercial Transport  VLCT  aiming to form a partnership to share the limited market In June 1994  Airbus announced its plan to develop its own very large airliner  designated as A3XX  Airbus considered several designs  including an unusual side by side combination of two fuselages from its A340  the largest Airbus jet at the time 19 The A3XX was pitted against the VLCT study and Boeing s

six launch customers  The A380 designation was a break from previous Airbus families  which had progressed sequentially from A300 to A340  It was chosen because the number 8 resembles the double deck cross section  and is a lucky number in some Asian countries where the aircraft was being marketed  The aircraft configuration was finalised in early 2001  and manufacturing of the first A380 wing box component started on 23 January 2002  The development cost of the A380 had grown to  11 billion when the first aircraft was completed', 'In 2014  the aircraft was estimated to have cost  25bn  16bn

degree of customisation for each airline  and failures of configuration management and change control  The German and Spanish Airbus facilities continued to use CATIA version 4  while British and French sites migrated to version 5  This caused overall configuration management problems  at least in part because wire harnesses manufactured using aluminium rather than copper conductors

checks were extended to cover all 68 A380 aircraft in operation  The problem is considered to be minor and is not expected to affect operations  EADS acknowledged that the cost of repairs would be over  130 million  to be borne by Airbus  The company said the problem was traced to stress and material used for the fittings  Additionally  major airlines are seeking compensation from Airbus for revenue lost as a result of the cracks and subsequent grounding of fleets  Airbus has switched to a different type of aluminium alloy so aircraft delivered from 2014 onwards should not have this problem', 'As Airbus expected to build 15 airliners in 2017 and 12 in 2018  Airbus Commercial Aircraft president Fabrice Br gier said that  without orders in 2017  production would be reduced below

2017  its chief executive Tom Enders was confident Airbus would still produce A380s in 2027 with more sales to come  and further develop it to keep it competitive beyond 2030 Airbus was profitable at a rate of 15 per year and is trying to drive breakeven down further but will take losses at eight per year', 'To extend the programme  Airbus offered China a production role in early 2018 While state owned Chinese airlines could order A380s  it would not help their low yield as it lowers frequency  they do not need more volume as widebody aircraft are already used on domestic routes and using the A380 on its intended long haul missions would free only a few airport slots', 'In February 2019  Airbus announced it will end the A380 production by 2021  after its main customer  Emirates  agreed to drop an order for 39 of the aircraft  replacing it with 40 A330 900s and 30 A350 900s  Airbus will build 17 more A380s before closing the production line  14 for Emirates and three for All Nippon Airways  taking the total number of expected deliveries of the aircraft type to 251  Airbus would have needed more than  90 million from the price of each aircraft to cover the estimated  25 billion development cost of the programme  However  the  445 million price tag of each aircraft was not sufficient to even cover the production cost  so with Airbus losing money on each A380  and orders evaporating  it makes economic sense to shut down production  Enders stated on 14 February 2019   If you have a product that nobody wants anymore  or you can sell only below production cost  you have to stop it', 'One reason that the A380 did not achieve commercial viability for Airbus has been attributed to its extremely large capacity being optimised for a hub and spoke system  which was projected by Airbus to be thriving when the programme was conceived  However  airlines underwent a fundamental transition to a point to point system  which gets customers to their destination in one flight instead of two or three  The massive scale of the A380 design was able to achieve a very low cost for passenger seat distance  but efficiency here within the hub and spoke paradigm was not able to overcome the efficiency of fewer flights required in the point to point system  Furthermore  American carriers had been using a multihub strategy  that would only justify the need for a handful of VLAs  very large aircraft with more than 400 seats  such as the A380  and having too few VLAs meant that they could not get achieve economy of scale to spread out the enormous fixed cost of the VLA support infrastructure  Consequently  the orders for VLAs slowed in the mid 2010s  as widebody twin jets now offer similar range and greater fuel efficiency  giving airlines more flexibility at a lower upfront cost', 'The A380 800 s original configuration carried 555 passengers in a three class  or 853 passengers  538 on the main deck and 315 on the upper deck  in a single class economy

required on the A380F freighter  The optimal wingspan for this weight is about 90 m  300 ft  but airport restrictions have limited it to less than 80 m  260 ft  thereby lowering the aspect ratio to 7 8 which reduces fuel  about 10  and increases operating costs a few percent  given that fuel costs constitute about 50  of the cost of long haul aeroplane operation', 'The common wing design approach sacrifices fuel efficiency on the A380 800 passenger model because of its weight  but Airbus estimates that the aircraft s size and advanced technology will provide lower operating costs per passenger than the 747 400  The wings incorporate wingtip fences that extend above and below the wing surface  similar to those on the A310 and A320  These increase fuel efficiency and range by reducing induced

acknowledged that some cabin proposals were unlikely to be installed  and that it was ultimately the airlines  decision how to configure the interior  Industry analysts suggested that implementing customisation has slowed the production speeds  and raised costs  Due to delivery delays  Singapore Airlines and Air France debuted their seat designs on different aircraft prior to the A380', 'Initial operators typically configured their A380s for three class service  while adding extra features for passengers in premium cabins  Launch customer Singapore Airlines introduced partly enclosed

5,Airbus A330,"['The Airbus A330 is a wide body airliner made by Airbus In the mid 1970s  Airbus conceived several derivatives of the A300  its first airliner  and developed the A330 twinjet in parallel with the A340 quadjet In June 1987  Airbus launched both designs with their first orders The A330 300  the first variant  took its maiden flight in November 1992 and entered service with Air Inter in January 1994 The slightly shorter A330 200 variant followed in 1998 In 2014  Airbus launched the A330neo  re engined with Trent 7000 turbofans  which entered service in November 2018', 'The A330 shares its airframe with the early A340 variants  having two engines instead of four  two main landing gear legs instead of three  lower weights and slightly different lengths Both airliners have fly by wire controls  which was first introduced on the A320  as well as a similar glass cockpit The A330 was Airbus s first airliner to offer a choice of three engines  the General Electric CF6  Pratt   Whitney PW4000  or the Rolls Royce Trent 700', 'The A330 300 has a range of 11 750 km or 6 350 nmi with 277 passengers  while the shorter A330 200 can cover 13 450 km or 7 250 nmi with 247 passengers Later variants include the A330 200F dedicated freighter  the A330 MRTT military tanker  and the ACJ330 corporate jet The A330 MRTT was proposed as the EADS Northrop Grumman KC 45 for the US Air Force s KC X competition  but lost to the Boeing KC 46 in appeal after an initial win', 'As of December 2019  A330 orders stand at 1 823 of which 1 492 have been delivered and 1 443 remain in operation Its largest operator is Turkish Airlines with 68 aircraft The A330 has allowed Airbus to expand its wide body market share It competes with the Boeing 767 and smaller variants of the 777 and the 787 It is complemented by the larger Airbus A350 XWB which succeeded the A340', 'Airbus s first airliner  the A300  was envisioned as part of a diverse family of commercial aircraft  Pursuing this goal  studies began in the early 1970s into derivatives of the A300  Before introducing the A300  Airbus identified nine possible variations designated B1 through B9  A tenth variant  the A300B10  was conceived in 1973 and developed into the longer range Airbus A310  Airbus then focused its efforts on single aisle  SA  studies  conceiving a family of airliners later known as the Airbus A320 family  the first commercial aircraft with digital fly by wire controls  During these studies Airbus turned its focus back to the wide body aircraft market  simultaneously working on both projects', 'In the mid 1970s  Airbus began development of the A300B9  a larger derivative of the A300  which would eventually become the A330  The B9 was essentially a lengthened A300 with the same wing  coupled with the most powerful turbofan engines available  It was targeted at the growing demand for high capacity  medium range  transcontinental trunk routes  Offering the same range and payload as the McDonnell Douglas DC 10 but with 25 per cent more fuel efficiency  the B9 was seen as a viable replacement for the DC 10 and the Lockheed L 1011 TriStar trijets  It was also considered as a medium ranged successor to the A300', 'At the same time  a 200 seat four engine version  the B11  which would eventually become the A340  was also under development  The B11 was originally planned to take the place of narrow body Boeing 707s and Douglas DC 8s then in commercial use  but would later evolve to target the long range  wide body trijet replacement market  To differentiate from the SA series  the B9 and B11 were re designated as the TA9 and TA11  with TA standing for  twin aisle  Development costs were reduced by the two aircraft using the same fuselage and wing  with projected savings of US 500 million  Another factor was the split preference of those within Airbus and  more importantly  those of prospective customers  twinjets were favoured in North America  quad jets desired in Asia  and operators had mixed views in Europe  Airbus ultimately found that most potential customers favoured four engines due to their exemption from existing twinjet range restrictions and their ability to be ferried with one inactive engine  As a result  development plans prioritised the four engined TA11 ahead of the TA9', 'The first specifications for the TA9 and TA11  aircraft that could accommodate 410 passengers in a one class layout  emerged in 1982  They showed a large underfloor cargo area that could hold five cargo pallets or sixteen LD3 cargo containers in the forward  and four pallets or fourteen LD3s in the aft hold double the capacity of the Lockheed L 1011 TriStar or DC 10  and 8 46 metres  27 8 ft  longer than the Airbus A300  By June 1985  the TA9 and TA11 had received more improvements  including the adoption of the A320 flight deck  digital fly by wire  FBW  control system  and side stick control  Airbus had developed a common cockpit for their aircraft models to allow quick transition by pilots  The flight crews could transition from one type to another after only one week s training  which reduces operator costs  The two TAs would use the vertical stabiliser  rudder  and circular fuselage sections of the A300 600  extended by two barrel sections', 'Airbus briefly considered the variable camber wing  a concept that requires changing the wing profile for a given phase of flight  Studies were carried out by British Aerospace  BAe  now part of BAE Systems  at Hatfield and Bristol  Airbus estimated this would yield a two per cent improvement in aerodynamic efficiency  but the feature was rejected because of cost and difficulty of development  A true laminar flow wing  a low drag shape that improves fuel efficiency  was also considered but rejected', 'With necessary funding available  the Airbus Supervisory Board approved the development of the A330 and A340 with potential customers on 27 January 1986  Its chairman Franz Josef Strauss stated afterwards that  Airbus Industrie is now in a position to finalise the detailed technical definition of the TA9  now officially designated as the A330  and the TA11  now called the A340  with potential launch customer airlines  and to discuss with them the terms and conditions for launch commitments  The designations were originally reversed and were switched so the quad jet airliner would have a  4  in its name  Airbus hoped for five airlines to sign for both the A330 and A340  and on 12 May sent sale proposals to the most likely candidates  including Lufthansa and Swissair', 'From the beginning of the TA9 s development  a choice of engines from the three major engine manufacturers  Rolls Royce  Pratt   Whitney  and GE Aviation  was planned  GE Aviation first offered the CF6 80C2  However  later studies indicated that more thrust was needed to increase the initial power capability from 267 to 289 kN  60 000 to 65 000 lbf  GE enlarged the CF6 80C2 fan from 236 to 244 centimetres  92 9 to 96 1 in  and reduced the number of fan blades from 38 to 34 to create the CF6 80E1 with a thrust of 300 320 kN  67 000 72 000 lbf', 'Rolls Royce initially wanted to use the 267 kN  60 000 lbf

invested heavily in new facilities  In England  BAe made a  7 million investment in a three storey technical centre with 15 000 m2  161 000 sq ft  of floor area at Filton  In Wales  BAe also spent  5 million on a new production line at its Broughton wing production plant  In Germany  Messerschmitt B lkow Blohm  MBB  invested DM400 million  225 million  on manufacturing facilities in the Weser estuary  including at Bremen  Einswarden  Varel  and Hamburg  France saw the biggest investments  with A rospatiale constructing a new Fr 2 5 billion  411 million  final assembly plant adjacent to Toulouse Blagnac Airport in Colomiers  by November 1988  the pillars for the new Cl ment Ader assembly hall had been erected  The assembly process featured increased automation  such as robots drilling holes and installing fasteners during the wing to fuselage mating process', 'On 12 March 1987  Airbus received the first orders for the twinjet  Domestic French airline Air Inter placed five firm orders and fifteen options  while Thai Airways International requested eight aircraft  split evenly between firm orders and options  Airbus announced the next day that it would formally launch the A330 and A340 programmes by April 1987  with deliveries of the A340 to begin in May 1992 and A330 deliveries to start in 1993  Northwest Airlines signed a letter of intent for twenty A340s and ten A330s on 31 March', 'BAe eventually received  450 million of funding from the UK government  well short of the  750 million it had originally requested for the design and construction of the wings  The German and French governments also provided funding  Airbus issued subcontracts to companies in Australia  Austria  Canada  China  Greece  Italy  India  Japan  South Korea  Portugal  the United States  and the former Yugoslavia  With funding in place  Airbus launched the A330 and A340 programmes on 5 June 1987  just prior to the Paris Air Show  At that time  the order book stood at 130 aircraft from ten customers  including lessor International Lease Finance Corporation  ILFC  Of the order total  forty one were for A330s  In 1989  Asian carrier Cathay Pacific joined the list of purchasers  ordering nine A330s and later increasing this number to eleven', 'The first completed A330 was rolled out on 14 October 1992  with the maiden flight following on 2 November  Weighing 181 840 kg  401 000 lb  including 20 980 kg  46 300 lb  of test equipment  the A330 became the biggest twinjet to have flown  until the later first flight of the Boeing 777  The flight lasted five hours and fifteen minutes during which speed  height  and other flight configurations were tested  Airbus intended the test flight programme to comprise six aircraft flying a total of 1 800 hours  On 21 October 1993  the Airbus A330 received the European Joint Aviation Authorities  JAA  and the US Federal Aviation Administration  FAA  certifications simultaneously after 1 114 cumulative airborne test hours and 426 test flights  At the same time  weight tests came in favourable  showing the plane was 500 kg  1 100 lb  under weight', 'On 30 June 1994  a fatal crash occurred during certification of the Pratt   Whitney engine when an A330 crashed near Toulouse  Both pilots and the five passengers died  The flight was designed to test autopilot response during a one engine off worst case scenario with the centre of gravity near its aft limit  Shortly after takeoff  the pilots had difficulty setting the autopilot  and the aircraft lost speed and crashed  An investigation by an internal branch of Direction Generale d Aviation concluded that the accident resulted from slow response and incorrect actions by the crew during the recovery  This led to a revision of A330 operating procedures', 'Air Inter became the first operator of the A330  having put the aircraft into service on 17 January 1994 between Orly Airport  Paris  and Marseille  Deliveries to Malaysia Airlines  MAS  and Thai Airways International were postponed to address delamination of the composite materials in the PW4168 engine s thrust reverser assembly  Thai Airways received its first A330 during the second half of the year  operating it on routes from Bangkok to Taipei and Seoul  Cathay Pacific received its Trent 700 A330s following the certification of that engine on 22 December 1994  MAS received its A330 on 1 February 1995 and then rescheduled its other ten orders', 'Airbus intended the A330 to compete in the Extended range Twin engine Operation Performance Standards  ETOPS  market  specifically with the Boeing 767   ETOPS is a standard that allows longer range flights away from a diversion airport for aircraft that have met special design and testing standards  Instead of the  ETOPS out of the box  or  Early ETOPS  approach taken by Boeing with its 777 1  Airbus gradually increased ETOPS approval on the A330 using in service experience  Airbus suggested that the A340 and the A330 were essentially identical except for their engine number  and that the A340 s experience could be applied to the A330 s ETOPS approval  The plans were for all three engine types to enter service with 90 minute approval  before increasing to 120 minutes after the total A330 fleet accumulated 25 000 flight hours  and then to 180 minutes after 50 000 flight hours  in 1995 2  Aer Lingus and Cathay Pacific were two important airlines assisting Airbus in this endeavour by building up in service flight hours on over ocean flights  In November 2009  the A330 became the first aircraft to receive ETOPS 240 approval  which has since been offered by Airbus as an option', 'Initially  the GE90 was only one of three B777 options  and GE Aviation then CEO Brian H  Rowe would have paid for the development of putting it on an A330  however  Airbus  strategy for long haul was the four engine A340  missing the market favouring twins', 'In response to a decline in A330 300 sales  increased market penetration by the Boeing 767 300ER  and airline requests for increased range and smaller aircraft  Airbus developed the Airbus A330 200  Known as the A329 and A330M10 during development  the A330 200 would offer nine per cent lower operating costs than the Boeing 767 300ER  The plane was aimed at the 11 900 km  6 430 nmi  7 390 mi  sector  where Airbus predicted demand for 800 aircraft between 1995 and 2015  The project  with US 450 million in expected development costs  was approved by the Airbus Industrie Supervisory Board on 24 November 1995', 'As Airbus worked on its A330 200  hydraulic pump problems were reported by both A330 and A340 operators  This issue was the suspected cause of a fire that destroyed an Air France A340 200 in January 1994  On 4 January of that year  a Malaysia Airlines A330 300  while undergoing regular maintenance at Singapore Changi Airport  was consumed by a fire that started in the right hand main undercarriage well  The incident caused US 30 million in damage  and the aircraft took six months to repair  Consequently  operators were advised to disable electrical pumps in January 1997', 'Responding to lagging A300 600F and A310F sales  Airbus began marketing the Airbus A330 200F  a freighter derivative of the A330 200  around 2001  The freighter has a range of 7 400 km  4 000 nmi  4 600 mi  with a 65 tonnes  140 000 lb  payload  or 5 900 km  3 200 nmi  3 700 mi  with 70 tonnes  150 000 lb  The plane utilises the same nosegear as the passenger version  however  it is attached lower in the fuselage and housed in a distinctive bulbous  blister fairing  This raises the aircraft s nose so that the cargo deck is level during loading  as the standard A330 s landing gear results the plane having a nose down attitude while on the ground', 'The A330 200F made its maiden flight on 5 November 2009  This marked the start of a four month  180 hour certification programme  JAA and FAA certifications were expected by March the following year although approval by the JAA was delayed until April  The first delivery was subsequently made to the Etihad Airways cargo division  Etihad Cargo  in July 2010', 'On 25 September 2013 at the Aviation Expo China  Beijing Airshow  Airbus announced a new lower weight A330 300 variant  optimised for use on domestic and regional routes in high growth markets with large populations and concentrated traffic flows  China and India were recognised as prime targets  This variant could carry up to 400 passengers  The increased efficiency  however  comes more from the installation of more seats than any weight reduction  On relatively short  yet congested routes  the A330 competes against single aisle jetliners  While the A330 s operating costs in these conditions are not far above those of the Boeing 737 or Airbus A321  the A320neo and 737 MAX promise more efficiency  Where the frequency of flights cannot be increased  using larger aircraft  such as the A330  is the only available option to increase capacity  The first customer for the A330 Regional was announced as Saudia at the 2015 Paris Air Show', 'The A330neo  neo  for  New Engine Option  is a development from the initial A330  now A330ceo   Current Engine Option  A new version with modern engines developed for the Boeing 787 was called for by owners of the current A330  It was launched in July 2014 at the Farnborough Airshow  promising 14  better fuel economy per seat  It will use the larger Rolls Royce Trent 7000 exclusively  Its two versions are based on the A330 200 and  300  the  800 should cover 8 150 nmi  15 090 km  with 257 passengers while the  900 should cover 7 200 nmi  13 330 km  with 287 passengers  The  900 made its first flight on 19 October 2017  received its EASA type certificate on 26 September 2018  and was first delivered to TAP Air Portugal on 26 November  The  800 made its first flight on 6 November 2018  aiming for a mid 2019 type certification and delivery in the first half of 2020', 'Several in flight shutdowns of Trent 700 powered A330 300s occurred  On 11 November 1996  engine failure on a Cathay Pacific flight forced it back to Ho Chi Minh City  On 17 April 1997  Cathay Pacific s Dragonair subsidiary experienced an engine shutdown on an A330  caused by carbon clogging the oil filter  As a result  Cathay Pacific self suspended its 120 minute ETOPS clearance  Another engine failure occurred on 6 May during climbout with a Cathay Pacific A330  due to a bearing failure in a Hispano Suiza built gearbox  Three days later  a Cathay Pacific A330 on climbout during a Bangkok Hong Kong flight experienced an oil pressure drop and a resultant engine spool down  forcing a return to Bangkok  The cause was traced to metal contamination in the engine s master chip  Following a fifth engine failure on 23 May  Cathay Pacific and Dragonair voluntarily grounded their A330 fleets for two weeks  causing major disruption as Cathay s eleven A330s made up fifteen per cent of its passenger capacity  Rolls Royce and Hispano Suiza developed a redesigned lubrication system to resolve the problem', 'Other engines have issues too  on 14 July 2015  an Asiana PW4000

raise production rates from seven and a half to eight per month to nine per month in 2012  and ten per month in 2013  Production increased to 10 aircraft per month in April 2013  the highest for any Airbus widebody aircraft  In 2012  Airbus expected the A330 to continue selling until at least 2020  with the A350 900 expected to replace the A330 300', 'On 19 July 2013  Airbus delivered its 1000th

January 2019  a total of 1 496 A330ceos had been ordered  with 1 437 delivered', 'In December 2014  Airbus announced that it would reduce A330 production to nine aircraft per month from ten  due to falling orders  Airbus did not rule out any further production cuts  The announcement led to an immediate drop in Airbus Group s stock price because the company derives a significant percentage of its cash flow and net profit from the A330 program  the A330 s financial impact is magnified amid problems in the A350 and A380 programs  In February 2015  Airbus announced that another production rate cut to six aircraft per month would begin in the first quarter of 2016  This would extend A330ceo production to July 2017  allowing for a smooth transition to A330neo production  which was set to start in spring 2017  In February 2016  Airbus announced that it will re increase the production rate from 6 to 7 per month  as response to new A330 orders', 'The last A330 200 was delivered to

000 lb  at introduction to 242 tonnes  534 000 lb  in 2015  enhancing its payload range performance  John Leahy states that it was intentionally being held down in takeoff weight and performance because Airbus avoided overlapping with the A340', 'The wing is swept back at 30 degrees and  along with other design features  allows a maximum operating Mach number of 0 86  To reach a long span and high aspect ratio without a large weight penalty  the wing has relatively high Thickness to chord ratio of 11 8  or 12 8  Jet airliners have Thickness to chord ratios ranging from 9 4   MD 11 or

6,Airbus A320 family,"['The Airbus A320 family are narrow body airliners designed and produced by Airbus The A320 was launched in March 1984  first flew on 22 February 1987  and was introduced in April 1988 by Air France The first member of the family was followed by the longer A321  first delivered in January 1994  the shorter A319  April 1996  and the even shorter A318  July 2003 Final assembly takes place in Toulouse in France  Hamburg in Germany  Tianjin in China since 2009  and in Mobile  Alabama in the United States since April 2016', 'The twinjet has a six abreast cross section and is powered by either CFM56 or IAE V2500 turbofans  except the CFM56 PW6000 powered A318 The family pioneered the use of digital fly by wire and side stick flight controls in airliners Variants

business jet versions', 'In December 2010  Airbus announced the re engined A320neo  new engine option  which entered service with Lufthansa in January 2016 With more efficient turbofans and improvements including sharklets  it offers up to 15  better fuel economy Earlier A320s are now called A320ceo  current engine option', 'In October 2019  it surpassed the Boeing 737 to become the highest selling airliner As of January 2020  a total of 9 273 aircraft have been delivered to more than 330 operators including low cost carriers  with 8 814 aircraft in service  American Airlines is the largest operator with 414 aircraft  Orders pending were 6 068  for a total of 15 315 orders The A320ceo initially competed with the MD 80 and the 737 Classic  then the MD 90 and the 737 Next Generation  while the 737 MAX is Boeing s response to the A320neo', 'When Airbus designed the Airbus A300 during the late 1960s and early 1970s  it envisaged a broad family of airliners with which to compete against Boeing and Douglas  two established US aerospace manufacturers  From the moment of formation  Airbus had begun studies into derivatives of the Airbus A300B in support of this long term goal  Prior to the service introduction of the first Airbus airliners  engineers within Airbus had identified nine possible variations of the A300 known as A300B1 to B9  A 10th variation  conceived in 1973  later the first to be constructed  was designated the A300B10  It was a smaller aircraft which would be developed into the long range Airbus A310  Airbus then focused its efforts on the single aisle market  which was dominated by the 737 and McDonnell Douglas DC 9', 'Plans from a number of European aircraft manufacturers called for a successor to the relatively successful BAC One Eleven  and to replace the 737 200 and DC 9  Germany s MBB  Messerschmitt B lkow Blohm  British Aircraft Corporation  Sweden s Saab and Spain s CASA worked on the EUROPLANE  a 180  to 200 seat aircraft  It was abandoned after intruding on A310 specifications  VFW Fokker  Dornier and Hawker Siddeley worked on a number of 150 seat designs', 'In June 1977 a new Joint European Transport  JET  programme was set up  established by BAe  Aerospatiale  Dornier and Fokker  It was based at the then British Aerospace  formerly Vickers  site in Weybridge  Surrey  UK  Although the members were all of Airbus  partners  they regarded the project as a separate collaboration from Airbus  This project was considered the forerunner of Airbus A320  encompassing the 130  to 188 seat market  powered by two CFM56s  It would have a cruise speed of Mach 0 84  faster than the Boeing 737  The programme was later transferred to Airbus  leading up to the creation of the Single Aisle  SA  studies in 1980  led by former leader of JET programme  Derek Brown  The group looked at three different variants  covering the 125  to 180 seat market  called SA1  SA2 and SA3  Although unaware at the time  the consortium was producing the blueprints for the A319  A320 and A321  respectively  The single aisle programme created divisions within Airbus about whether to design a shorter range twinjet rather than a longer range quadjet wanted by the West Germans  particularly Lufthansa  However  works proceeded  and the German carrier would eventually order the twinjet', 'In February 1981 the project was re designated A320  with efforts focused on the former SA2  During the year  Airbus worked with Delta Air Lines on a 150 seat aircraft envisioned and required by the airline  The A320 would carry 150 passengers over 5 280 or 3 440 km  2 850 or 1 860 nmi  using fuel from wing fuel tanks only  The Dash 200 had centre tank activated  increasing fuel capacity from 15 590 to 23 430 L  3 429 to 5 154 imp gal  They would measure 36 04 and 39 24 m  118 ft 3 in and 128 ft 9 in  respectively  Airbus considered a fuselage diameter of  the Boeing 707 and 727  or do something better  and settled on a wider cross section with a 3 7 m  12 ft 2 in  internal width  compared to Boeing s 3 45 m  11 ft 4 in  Although heavier  this allowed to compete more effectively with the 737  The A320 wing went through several stages of design  finally settling on 33 91 m  111 ft 3 in', 'France was willing to commit to a launch aid  or subsidies  while the Germans were more cautious  The UK government was unwilling to provide funding for the tooling requested by British Aerospace  BAe  and estimated at  250 million  it was postponed for three years  On 1 March 1984 the government and the manufacturer agreed that  50 million would be paid whether the A320 would fly or not  while the rest would be paid as a levy on each aircraft sold', 'The programme was launched on 2 March 1984  At this time  Airbus had 96 orders 48 Air France was its first customer with a  letter of intent  for 25 A320s and an option for 25 more at the 1981 Paris air show  In October 1983  British Caledonian placed seven firm orders  bringing total orders to more than 80  Cyprus Airways became the first to place order for V2500 powered A320s in November 1984  followed by Pan Am with 16 firm orders and 34 options in January 1985  then Inex Adria 49 One of the most significant orders was when Northwest Airlines placed an order for 100 A320s in October 1986  later confirmed at the 1990 Farnborough Airshow  powered by CFM56 engines 49 50', 'During the A320 development programme  Airbus considered propfan technology  backed by Lufthansa  At the time unproven  it was essentially a fan placed outside the engine nacelle  offering speed of a turbofan at turboprops economics  eventually  Airbus stuck with turbofans', 'Power on the A320 would be supplied by two CFM56 5 A1s rated at 25 000 lbf  111 2 kN  It was the only available engine at launch until the IAE V2500  offered by International Aero Engines  a group composed of Rolls Royce plc  Pratt   Whitney  Japanese Aero Engine Corporation  Fiat and MTU  The first V2500 variant  the V2500 A1  has a thrust output of 25 000 pounds force  110 kN  hence the name  It is 4  more efficient than the CFM56  with cruise thrust specific fuel consumption for the  A5 at 0

Aviation Authorities certification was delivered on 26 February 1988 50 The first A320 was delivered to Air France on 28 March 1988', 'The first derivative of the A320 was the Airbus A321  also known as the Stretched A320  A320 500 and A325  Its launch came on 24 November 1988 after commitments for 183 aircraft from 10 customers were secured  The aircraft would be a minimum changed derivative  apart from a number of minor modifications to the wing  and the fuselage stretch itself  The wing would incorporate double slotted flaps and minor trailing edge modifications  increasing the wing area from 124 m2  1 330 sq ft  to 128 m2  1 380 sq ft  The fuselage was lengthened by four plugs  two ahead and two behind the wings  giving the A321 an overall length of 6 94 metres  22 ft 9 in  longer than the A320  The length increase required the overwing exits of the A320 to be enlarged and repositioned in front of and behind the wings  The centre fuselage and undercarriage were reinforced to accommodate the increase in maximum takeoff weight of 9 600 kg  21 200 lb  taking it to 83 000 kg  183 000 lb', 'Final assembly for the A321 would be  as a first for any Airbus  carried out in Germany  then West Germany  This came after a dispute between the French  who claimed the move would incur  150 million  135 million  in unnecessary expenditure associated with the new plant  and the Germans  arguing it would be more productive for Airbus in the long run  The second production line was located at Hamburg  which would also subsequently produce the smaller Airbus A319 and A318  For the first time  Airbus entered the bond market  through which it raised  480 million  475 million  to finance development costs  An additional  180 million  175 million  was borrowed from European Investment Bank and private investors', 'The A319 is the next derivative of the baseline A320  The design is a  shrink  with its origins in the 130  to 140 seat SA1  part of the Single Aisle studies  The SA1 was shelved as the consortium concentrated on its bigger siblings  After healthy sales of the A320 A321  Airbus re focused on what was then known as the A320M 7  meaning A320 minus seven fuselage frames  It would provide direct competition for the 737 300 700  The shrink was achieved through the removal of four fuselage frames fore and three aft of the wing  cutting the overall length by 3 73 metres  12 ft 3 in  Consequently  the number of overwing exits was reduced from four to two  The bulk cargo door was replaced by an aft container door  which can take in reduced height LD3 45 containers  Minor software changes were made to accommodate the different handling characteristics  otherwise the aircraft is largely unchanged  Power is provided by the CFM56 5A or V2500 A5  derated to 98 kN  22

Airbus A318  In early 1998  Airbus revealed its considerations of designing a 100 seat aircraft based on the A320  The AE31X project was terminated by September 1998  after which Airbus officially announced an aircraft of its own  the A318  at that year s Farnborough Airshow  The aircraft is the smallest product of Airbus s product range  and was developed coincidentally at the same time as the largest commercial aircraft in history  the Airbus A380  First called A319M5 in as early as March 1995  it was shorter by 0 79 metre  2 ft 7 in  ahead of the wing and 1 6 metres  5 ft 3 in  behind

7,Airbus A340,"['The Airbus A340 is a long range  wide body commercial passenger jet airliner that was developed and produced by the European aerospace company Airbus In the mid 1970s  Airbus conceived several derivatives of the A300  its first airliner  and developed the A340 quadjet in parallel with the A330 twinjet In June 1987  Airbus launched both designs with their first orders and the A340 300 took its maiden flight on 25 October 1991 It was certified along with the A340 200 on 22 December 1992 and both versions entered service in March 1993 with launch customers Lufthansa and Air France The larger A340 500 600 were launched on 8 December 1997  the A340 600 flew for the first time on 23 April 2001 and entered service on 1 August 2002', 'Keeping the eight abreast economy cross section of the A300  the early A340 200 300 has a similar airframe to the A330 Differences include four 151 kN  34 000 lbf  CFM56s instead of two turbofans to avoid ETOPS restrictions on trans oceanic routes  and a three leg main landing gear instead of two for a heavier 276 t  608 000 lb  MTOW Both airliners have fly by wire controls  which was first introduced on the A320  as well as a similar glass cockpit The later A340 500 600 have a larger wing and are powered by 275 kN  62 000 lbf  Rolls Royce Trent 500 for a heavier 380 t  840 000 lb  MTOW', 'As improving engine reliability allowed ETOPS operations for almost all routes  more economical twinjets have replaced quadjets on many routes On 10 November 2011 Airbus announced the production reached its end  after 380 orders had been placed and 377 were delivered from Toulouse  France The A350 XWB is proposed as a successor   the MD 11 and the Boeing 777 were its main competitors Lufthansa is the largest operator and the largest customer with 62 aircraft in total  and continues to operate 24 aircraft as of April  2020', 'When Airbus designed the Airbus A300 during the 1970s it envisioned a broad family of airliners to compete against Boeing and McDonnell Douglas  two established US aerospace manufacturers  From the moment of formation  Airbus had begun studies into derivatives of the Airbus A300B in support of this long term goal  Prior to the service introduction of the first Airbus airliners  Airbus had identified nine possible variations of the A300 known as A300B1 to B9  A tenth variation  conceived in 1973  later the first to be constructed  was designated the A300B10  It was a smaller aircraft that would be developed into the long range Airbus A310  Airbus then focused its efforts on the single aisle market  which resulted in the Airbus A320 family  which was the first digital fly by wire commercial aircraft  The decision to work on the A320  instead of a four engine aircraft proposed by the Germans  created divisions within Airbus  As the SA or  single aisle  studies  which later became the successful Airbus A320  underwent development to challenge the successful Boeing 737 and Douglas DC 9 in the single aisle  narrow body airliner market  Airbus turned its focus back to the wide body aircraft market', 'The A300B11  a derivative of the A310  was designed upon the availability of  ten ton  thrust engines  Using four engines  it would seat between 180 and 200 passengers  and have a range of 11 000 kilometres  6 000 nmi  It was deemed a replacement for the less efficient Boeing 707s and Douglas DC 8s still in service  The A300B11 was joined by another design  the A300B9  which was a larger derivative of the A300  The B9 was developed by Airbus from the early 1970s at a slow pace until the early 1980s  It was essentially a stretched A300 with the same wing  coupled with the most powerful turbofan engine available at the time  It was targeted at the growing demand for high capacity  medium range  transcontinental trunk routes  The B9 offered the same range and payload as the McDonnell Douglas DC 10  but it used between 25  to 38  less fuel  The B9 was therefore considered a replacement for the DC 10 and the Lockheed L 1011 Tristar', 'To differentiate the programme from the SA studies  the B9 and B11 were redesignated the TA9 and TA11  TA standing for  twin aisle  respectively  In an effort to save development costs  it was decided that the two would share the same wing and airframe  the projected savings were estimated at US 500 million  about  490 million or  495 million  The adoption of a common wing structure also had one technical advantage  the TA11 s outboard engines could counteract the weight of the longer range model by providing bending relief  Another factor was the split preference of those within Airbus and  more importantly  prospective airliner customers  Airbus vice president for strategic planning  Adam Brown  recalled', 'The first specifications of the TA9 and TA11 were released in 1982  While the TA9 had a range of 6 100 kilometres  3 300 nmi  the TA11 range was up to 12 650 kilometres  6 830 nmi  At the same time  Airbus also sketched the TA12  a twin engine derivative of the TA11  which was optimised for flights of a 3 700 kilometres  2 000 nmi  lesser range  By the time of the Paris Air Show in June 1985  more refinements had been made to the TA9 and TA11  including the adoption of the A320 flight deck  fly by wire  FBW  flight control system and side stick control  Adopting a common cockpit across the new Airbus series allowed operators to make significant cost savings  flight crews would be able to transition from one to another after one week of training  The TA11 and TA12 would use the front and rear fuselage sections of the A310  Components were modular and also interchangeable with other Airbus aircraft where  to reduce production  maintenance and operating costs', 'Airbus briefly considered a variable camber wing  the concept was that the wing could change its profile to produce the optimum shape for a given phase of flight  Studies were carried out by British Aerospace  BAe  at Hatfield and Bristol  Airbus estimated this would yield a 2  improvement in aerodynamic efficiency  However  the plan was later abandoned on grounds of cost and difficulty of development', 'Airbus had held discussions with McDonnell Douglas to jointly produce the aircraft  which would have been designated as the AM 300  This aeroplane would have combined the wing of the A330 with the fuselage of the McDonnell Douglas MD 11  However  talks were terminated as McDonnell Douglas insisted on the continuation of its trijet heritage  Although from the start it was intended that the A340 would be powered by four CFM56 5 turbofan engines  each capable of 25 000 pounds force  110 kN  Airbus had also considered developing the aircraft as a trijet due to the limited power of engines available at the time  namely the Rolls Royce RB211 535 and Pratt   Whitney JT10D   redesignated PW2000 in December 1980', 'As refinements in the A340 s design proceeded  a radical new engine option was offered by International Aero Engines  a group comprising Rolls Royce  Pratt   Whitney  Japanese Aero Engines Corporation  Fiat and MTU Aero Engines  MTU  The engine nacelles of the superfan engine consisted of provisions to allow a large fan near the rear of the engine  As a result of the superfan cancellation by IAE  the CFM56 5C4 was used as the sole engine choice instead of there being an alternate option as originally envisioned  The longer range versions  namely the A340 500 and  600  are powered by Rolls Royce Trent 500 engines', 'On 27 January 1986  the Airbus Industrie Supervisory Board held a meeting in Munich  West Germany  after which board chairman Franz Josef Strau  released a statement   Airbus Industrie is now in a position to finalise the detailed technical definition of the TA9  which is now officially designated the A330  and the TA11  now called the A340  with potential launch customer airlines  and to discuss with them the terms and conditions for launch commitments  The designations were originally reversed because the airlines believed it illogical for a two engine jet airliner to have a  4  in its name  whilst a quad jet would not  On 12 May 1986  Airbus dispatched fresh sale proposals to five prospective airlines including Lufthansa and Swissair', 'In preparations for production of the A330 A340  Airbus s partners invested heavily in new facilities  Filton was the site of BAE s  7 million investment in a three storey technical centre with an extra 15 000 square metres  160 000 sq ft  of floor area  BAe also spent  5 million expanding the Broughton wing production plant by 14 000 m2  150 000 sq ft  to accommodate a new production line  However  France saw the biggest changes with A rospatiale starting construction of a new Fr 2 5 billion  411 million  assembly plant  adjacent to Toulouse Blagnac Airport  in Colomiers  By November 1988  the first 21 m  69 ft  pillars were erected for the new Cl ment Ader assembly hall  The assembly process  meanwhile  would feature increased automation with holes for the wing fuselage mating process drilled by eight robots  The use of automation for this particular process saved Airbus 20  on labour costs and 5  on time', 'British Aerospace accepted  450 million funding from the UK government  short of the  750 million originally requested  Funds from the French and German governments followed thereafter  Airbus also issued subcontracts to companies in Austria  Australia  Canada  China  Greece  Italy  India  Japan  South Korea  Portugal  the United States  and the former Yugoslavia  The A330 and A340 programmes were jointly launched on 5 June 1987  just prior to the Paris Air Show  The order book then stood at 130 aircraft from 10 customers  apart from the above mentioned Lufthansa and International Lease Finance Corporation  ILFC  Eighty nine of the total orders were A340 models  At McDonnell Douglas  ongoing tests of the MD 11 revealed a significant shortfall in the aircraft s performance  An important carrier  Singapore Airlines  SIA  required a fully laden aircraft that could fly from Singapore to Paris  against strong headwinds during mid winter in the northern hemisphere  The MD 11  according to test results  would experience fuel starvation over the Balkans  Due to the less than expected performance figures  SIA cancelled its 20 aircraft MD 11 order on 2 August 1991  and ordered 20 A340 300s instead  As only 200 units were sold  words  consider the MD 11 a failure and that it could not compete against the A340', 'The first flight of the A340 occurred on 21 October 1991  marking the start of a 2 000 hour test flight programme involving six aircraft  From the start  engineers noticed that the wings were not stiff enough to carry the outboard engines at cruising speed without warping and fluttering  To alleviate this  an underwing bulge called a plastron was developed to correct airflow problems around the engine  and to add stiffness  European JAA certification was obtained on 22 December 1992  the FAA followed on 27 May 1993', 'The first A340  a  200  was delivered to Lufthansa on 2 February 1993 and entered service on 15 March  The 228 seat airliner was named N rnberg  The first A340 300  the 1000th Airbus  was delivered to Air France on 26 February  the first of nine it planned to operate by the

this was the first non stop flight between Europe and New Zealand and the longest non stop flight by an airliner at the time  The 19 277 km  10 409 nmi  flight from Paris to Auckland broke six world records with 22 persons and five center tanks  Taking off at 11 58 local time  it arrived back in Paris 48 hours and 22 minutes later  at 12 20  This record held until 1997 when a Boeing 777 200ER

inspections', 'The A340 has a low cantilever wing  the A340 200 300 wing is virtually identical to that of the A330  with both engine pylons used while only the inboard one is used on the A330  The two engines for each wing provide a more distributed weight  and a more outboard engine weight for a lower wing root bending moment at equal TOW  allowing a higher wing limited MTOW for more range  The wings were designed and manufactured by BAe  which developed a long slender wing with a high aspect ratio for a higher aerodynamic efficiency', 'The wing is swept back at 30 degrees  allowing a

flights stress aircraft more than long flights and result in more frequent fuel thirsty take offs and landings  ultra long flights require completely full fuel tanks  The higher weights in turn require a greater proportion of an aircraft s fuel fraction just to take off and to stay airborne  In 2008  Air France KLM SA s chief executive Pierre Henri Gourgeon disparagingly referred to the A340 as a  flying tanker with a few people on board  While Thai Airways consistently filled 80  of the seats on its New York City Bangkok flights  it estimated that  at 2008 fuel prices  it would need an impossible 120  of seats filled just to break even  Other airlines also re examined long haul flights  In August 2008 Cathay Pacific stated that rising fuel costs were hurting its trans Pacific long haul routes disproportionately  and that it would cut the number of such flights and redeploy its aircraft to shorter routes such as between Hong Kong and Australia   We will   our network where

unpopular  The  500 series was considered  very inefficient for how few seats they have because they still carry most of the guts of the larger airplanes A340 600  from which they were shrunk  Also the ultra long haul market was a niche that was difficult to profit from  due to the amount of fuel that had to be carried  In addition  the  500 could not meet its maximum range without carrying a reduced load of passengers  so several operators reconfigured their  500s from a mix of business and premium economy to an all business class with 100 seats needed  As of March 2020  there were 2 A340

development of the 300 seat Airbus A300  This collaborative effort resulted in the production of the consortium s first airliner  known as the Airbus A300  The A300 was a wide body medium to long range passenger liner  it holds the distinction of being the first twin engine wide body aircraft in the world  The design was relatively revolutionary for its time and featured a number of industry firsts  making the first use of composite materials on a commercial aircraft  during 1977  the A300 became the first ETOPS compliant aircraft  which was made possible due to its high performance and safety standards  The A300 would be produced in a range of models and sold relatively well to airlines across the world  eventually reaching a total of 816 delivered aircraft during its production life', 'In order to minimise the associated research   development costs for the tentative project  Airbus chose to examine several early design studies performed during the A300 program  The company ultimately chose to prioritise its focus on one option  which became known as the A300B10MC  standing for Minimum Change  As envisioned  the airliner s capacity was reduced to a maximum of 220 passengers  which was viewed at the time as being a desired capacity amongst many airlines  However  such a design would have resulted in a relatively small fuselage being mated to a comparatively large wing and oversized undercarriage  such an arrangement would have  amongst other things  made the aircraft consume an unnecessarily larger amount of fuel as it carried heavier weight than what was otherwise required', 'Another problem for the program was presented in the form of inflation  the rate of which in the United Kingdom  one of the early members of the Airbus consortium  was around 35 per cent during 1979 80  This factor was responsible for significantly raising the program s development costs and  as a knock on effect  increase the per unit cost of the resulting airliner  During the development of the A300  British manufacturer Hawker Siddeley Aviation  HSA  had been appointed as the subcontractor to perform the manufacturing of the wing of the aircraft  shortly afterwards  the British government chose to withdraw from the newly formed venture during 1969  During 1977  HSA subsequently merged with three other British aircraft companies  resulting in the formation of British Aerospace  BAe  By this point  the British government had publicly indicated its intentions to rejoin the Airbus program  During May 1976  the French government entered into a series of discussions on cooperation  during which its representatives stated that the placing of an order by British Airways  BA  was a condition for the re admission of the United Kingdom into Airbus Industrie as a full partner', 'However  both BA and Rolls Royce had not relinquished their will to collaborate with the Americans in future aircraft endeavours and  in BA s case  procure

the 757 and 767  the latter of which being an intended rival to the upcoming A310  as well as the existing Boeing 747  Independent of the British government  BAe commenced its own dialogue between itself and American aircraft manufacturers Boeing and McDonnell Douglas for the purpose of assessing if BAe could participate any of their future programs  although the company s chairman  Lord Beswick  publicly stated that the overall aim of the firm was to pursue collaboration in Europe  At the 1978 Farnborough Air Show  Eric Varley  the British Secretary of State for Industry  announced that BAe was to rejoin Airbus Industrie and participate as a full partner from 1 January 1979 onwards  Under the negotiated arrangement  BAe would be allocated a 20 per cent shareholding in Airbus Industrie and would perform  a full part in the development and manufacturing of the A310', 'From late 1977  prior to the Varley announcement  BAe had already commenced work on the design of the new wing at its facility in Hatfield  However  due to negotiations with Britain on its return to the Airbus consortium being protracted  alternative options were explored  including potentially manufacturing the wing elsewhere  At the same time as the British efforts  French aerospace firm A rospatiale  German aircraft manufacturer Messerschmitt B lkow Blohm  MBB  and Dutch German joint venture company VFW Fokker were also conducting their individual studies into possible options for the wing of the prospective airliner needed', 'At the April 1978 Hanover Air Show  Airbus exhibited a model of the proposed A310  Its wing area  at 219 25 m2  2 360 0 sq ft  was slightly larger than that studied  at 209 m2  2 250 sq ft  its passenger cabin was 12 frames shorter than the A300 Note 2 accommodating typical passenger loads of 195 in two class  or 245 in economy  However  during the next 12 months  almost every aspect was further refined  On 9 June 1978  Swissair and Lufthansa developed a joint specification for the aircraft  and within a month  announced that they would place the launch orders  On 15 March  Swissair became the first airline to place a firm order for the type  announcing that it would acquire 10 with a further 10 under option to replace its McDonnell Douglas DC 9s on its major intra European routes  Lufthansa was quick to place a  240 million 10 aircraft order  additional orders from French operator Air France and Spanish airline Iberia shortly followed', 'As a consequence of increasingly strong interest in the tentative airliner  coupled with the recovery of the industry during the late 1970s  contributed to Airbus deciding to launch the A300B10  which was now known as the A310  into production on 7 July 1978 needed  During the latter half of 1978  an order for 10 A300s was placed by independent British airline Laker Airways  satisfying Airbus s demand for the placing of a British order for their aircraft  On 1 April 1979  Lufthansa decided to raise its commitment for the type to 25 orders  along with 25 options  Two days later  Dutch operator KLM signed its order for 10 orders and 10 options at  238 million  On 6 July 1979  Air France announced that it had raised its order from 4 to 35 airliners needed  Other airlines announcing orders for the A310 during 1979 included Martinair  Sabena and Air Afrique', 'The A310 has been commonly marketed as an introduction to wide body operations for airlines based in developing countries  The airliner was replaced in Airbus  lineup by the highly successful A330 200  which shares its fuselage cross section  Between 1983 and the last aircraft produced in 1998  255 A310s were delivered  The A300 and A310 established Airbus as a competitor to Boeing and allowed it to go ahead with the more ambitious A320 and A330 A340 families needed', 'The Royal Canadian Air Force currently operates a fleet of 5 Airbus CC 150 Polaris  civilian Airbus A310 300s  originally owned by Wardair  and subsequently Canadian Airlines International  after the airlines merged  The aircraft were then sold to the Canadian Government and have been converted for use as the primary long distance transport aircraft as part of the Royal Canadian Air Force s fleet of Royal Canadian Air Force VIP aircraft', 'The Airbus A310 was a medium  to long range twin engined wide body airliner  Initially a derivative of the A300  the aircraft had originally been designated the A300B10  It was essentially a shortened variant of the earlier aircraft  however  there were considerable differences between the two aircraft  Specifically  the fuselage possessed the same cross section but being shorter than the A300  it provided capacity for a typical maximum of 200 passengers  The rear fuselage was heavily re designed  featuring altered tapering  while involved a move aft of the rear bulkhead to create additional capacity  this same design change was later transferred back to later variants of the A300  such as the A300 600 and A330 A340 fuselages  The A310 also had a different emergency exit configuration  consisting of four main doors  two at the front and two at the rear of the aircraft  and two smaller doors over the wings needed', 'The wing of the A310 was redesigned  possessing a reduced span and wing area and incorporating simpler single slotted Fowler flaps designed by British Aerospace shortly following its decision to join the Airbus consortium  Other changes to the wing included the elimination of the outer ailerons  which were occasionally referred to by the manufacturer as being  low speed ailerons  and the addition of electrically actuated spoilers  The wing also featured common pylons  which were able to support all types of engines that were offered to customers to power the airliner  From 1985 onwards  later built production A310s were equipped with wingtip fences for the purpose of reducing lift induced drag  A limited number of alternations were also performed to the airliner s tail unit  such as the adoption of smaller horizontal tail surfaces', 'The A310 was furnished with a two crew glass cockpit configuration as standard  removing the requirement for a flight engineer  Airbus referred to this concept as the Forward Facing Crew Cockpit  The company had developed the cockpit to significantly enhance the aircraft s man machine interface  thereby improving operational safety  It was outfitted with an array of six computer based CRT displays to provide the flight crew with centralised navigational  warning  monitoring  and general flight information in place of the more traditional analogue instrumentation and dials  which were used in conjunction with a range of modern electronic systems  The same flight deck had been incorporated into the A300 600  a move which increased commonality between the two types and enabled a dual type rating to be achieved  this same approach was later used on many future Airbus aircraft  In addition to the two flying crew  provisions for third and fourth crew seats were present upon the flight deck', 'The A310 was equipped with a modified undercarriage  derived from the A300  the landing gear were outfitted with carbon brakes  which were fitted as standard  The structure of the airliner featured a high level of composite materials throughout both primary and secondary structures  increased beyond that of the earlier A300  The A310 is outfitted with integrated drive electrical generators along with auxiliary power unit  which were improved versions of those used on the A300']"

13,Airbus Beluga,"['The Airbus A300 600ST  Super Transporter  or Beluga  is a version of the standard A300 600 wide body airliner modified to carry aircraft parts and oversized cargo  It received the official name of Super Transporter early on  however  the name Beluga  a whale it resembles  gained popularity and has since been officially adopted  The Beluga XL  based on the Airbus A330 with similar modifications and dimensions  was developed by Airbus to replace the type in January 2020', 'Several major aircraft manufacturers are multinational  and it is not unusual for them to have plants in widely separated locations  Airbus is unique in that although it is today a standalone multinational corporation  it was originally a consortium formed by the major British  French  German  and Spanish aerospace companies  The geographic location of Airbus manufacturing is not only influenced by cost and convenience  it is also a matter of aviation history and national interest  Historically  each of the Airbus partners makes an entire aircraft section  which would then be transported to a central location for final assembly  even after the integration of Airbus into a single firm  the arrangement remained largely the same  with Airbus partners becoming subsidiaries or contractors of the multinational pan European company  The details vary from one model to another  but the general arrangement is for the wings and landing gear to be made in the UK  the tail and doors in Spain  the fuselage in Germany  and the nose and centre section in France  with final assembly in either Toulouse  France  Hamburg  Germany  or Seville  Spain', 'When Airbus started in 1970  road vehicles were initially used for the movement of components and sections  however  growth in production volume soon necessitated a switch to air transport  From 1972 onwards  a fleet of four highly modified  Super Guppies  took over  These were former Boeing Stratocruisers from the 1940s that had been converted with custom fuselages and the adoption of turbine engines to carry large volume loads for NASA s space program in the 1960s  Airbus  use of the Super Guppies led to the jest that  every Airbus is delivered on the wings of a Boeing  As time went on  the Super Guppies grew increasingly unsatisfactory for Airbus s ferrying needs  their age meant that operating expenses were high and ever increasing  and growing Airbus production required greater capacity than could be provided by the existing fleet', 'Several different types of aircraft were examined for potential use  including the Antonov An 124  Antonov An 225  Ilyushin Il 86  Boeing 747  Boeing 767  Lockheed C 5 Galaxy  and McDonnell Douglas C 17 Globemaster III  the use of any existing aircraft was eventually discounted due to a lack of internal space to accommodate the desired components  the use of a piggyback arrangement was also dismissed as impractical  Boeing made their own offer to convert several Boeing 767s for the requirement  but this was viewed as inferior to developing a purpose built aircraft using Airbus  existing wide body twin engined Airbus A300 600R instead', 'In August 1991  A rospatiale and DASA  two of the major Airbus partners  formed a 50 50 joint venture company  Super Airbus Transport International  SATIC  based in Toulouse  France  to develop a new build replacement for the Super Guppy fleet  The selected starting point for the design was the Airbus A300  leading to the new airframe being designated as the A300 600ST Super Transporter  Following a pre design period by SATIC  detailed design work was performed by A rospatiale and DASA while subcontractors were selected to complete the 15 separate work packages  amongst these subcontractors  CASA was selected to produce the upper fuselage  Dornier provided the hydraulic systems  and Sogerma performed the final assembly work  The A300 600ST was not a like for like replacement  being larger  faster  and more efficient than the preceding Super Guppies  Airbus Industries elected to invest  1 billion into the program  this sum included the aircraft themselves  the cargo loading system  and program management', 'In September 1992  construction work began on the first aircraft  the maiden flight of which took place in September 1994  Following a total of 335 flight hours being performed during the test program  restricted certification of the type was awarded by the European Aviation Safety Agency  EASA  in October 1995  enabling the A300 600ST  Beluga  to enter service shortly thereafter  In addition to the first aircraft  four more Belugas were constructed at a rate of roughly one per year  from start to finish  each airframe reportedly took roughly three years to complete  Modification work was performed at Toulouse using components provided by the Airbus assembly line  Originally a total of four aircraft were to be built along with an option for a fifth aircraft being available  which was later firmed up', 'In late 1997  in response to the positive performance of the A300 600ST Super Transporter program  SATIC announced that they were in the process of evaluating several different prospective outsize freighter conversions  company chairman Udo Dr ger indicated that a larger freighter based on the Airbus A340 could be developed in a similar manner to that of the A300 based Beluga  At the time  derivatives of both the Airbus A330 and the A340 were being studied  including combining the upward swinging hinged door of the Beluga with a conventional upper deck as an alternative to a side mounted cargo door in traditional freighter missions  During the 1990s  as a result of reported inquiries to Airbus regarding the type  a niche market for selling Beluga type aircraft to military customers and freight operators was also examined  but sales were considered  unlikely  to take place by the late 1990s', 'In November 2014  Airbus announced that it was proceeding with the development of a larger replacement based on the Airbus A330 200  five of which will start operating from 2019  replacing the last old Beluga in 2025  Airbus previously considered the A330 300 and A340 500  but each require too much of the limited 1 663 m  5 456 ft  runway 04 at Hawarden Airport near Broughton in Wales  In May 2015  Airbus confirmed that the new aircraft will have a 1 m  3 ft 3 in  wider cross section than its predecessor and provide a 12  increase in payload  The Beluga XL is intended primarily for A350 work  and is designed with capacity to ship two A350 wings simultaneously  Five aircraft will be progressively assembled  the first two are considered essential to ramping up production of the A350  the remaining three are to be introduced as the A300 600 Beluga fleet retires', 'The A300 600ST Beluga shares many design similarities  although substantially differing in appearance  to the Airbus A300 it was based upon  The wings  engines  landing gear  and the lower part of the fuselage remain identical to those used on the conventional A300  while the upper part of the fuselage forms an enormous horseshoe shaped structure 7 7 m  25 ft  in diameter  In comparison with the Super Guppy  the payload was more than doubled and the volume increased by more than 30 per cent  The General Electric CF6 80C2 turbofan engines used are slightly uprated from those used on the standard A300 as well  The vertical stabilizer uses a modified Airbus A340 fin with a 1 12 m  3 ft 8 in  base extension while the tailplane was strengthened and fitted with auxiliary fins to maintain directional stability  The tailplane trim tank was also deleted', 'To provide access to the cargo area from the front without having to disconnect all electrical  hydraulic and flight control connections  and also avoiding the lengthy recalibrations before each flight that reconnection entailed  the standard A300 cockpit was relocated down below the cargo floor level  By relocating the cockpit in this manner  loading times were reportedly halved from those encountered using the Super Guppy  which had needed to disconnect and reconnect such systems  Another reason for faster loading times was the adoption of a roll on roll off loading system  as well as the ability to unload the aircraft in winds of up to 40 knots  The qualities and improved capabilities of the Beluga resulted in the costs associated with transporting Airbus components dropping to only one third of those achieved by the Super Guppy', 'The main deck cargo volume of the Beluga is greater than that of the C 5 Galaxy or the Antonov An 124 but still smaller than Antonov An 225  However  it is restricted by cargo weight capacity of 47 tonnes  compared to 122 5 tonnes for the C 5 Galaxy and 150 tonnes for the An 124  Despite this width  the Beluga cannot carry most fuselage parts of the Airbus A380  which are instead normally transported by ship and road  The Beluga has been used to transport some A380 components', 'In January 1996  the Beluga was formally placed into dedicated service  ferrying components from various aerospace sites to the final assembly lines in Toulouse  France and Hamburg  Germany  On 24 October 1997  the last of Airbus Industrie s Super Guppy freighters was retired and its outsize cargo mission from that point onwards being exclusively performed by the new A300 600ST fleet  In 1997  the second year of Beluga operations  the fleet accumulated in excess of 2 500 flight hours across more than 1 400 flights  By 2012  the fleet was performing roughly 5 000 flight hours per year  Airbus expected this figure to double by 2017', 'Since entering service  the Beluga has been subject to several infrastructure upgrades  In 2011  Pau Pyr n es Airport  a site routinely visited by Belugas  became the first airport in Europe to deploy the European Geostationary Navigation Overlay Service  which accurately guides the Beluga and other aircraft during landing  In 2015  a dedicated Beluga loading station was opened at Hawarden Airport  preventing high winds from disrupting future operations', 'In June 1997  a world record was set for the most voluminous payload to be carried by an aircraft when a Beluga was used to transport a chemical tank for a merchant vessel from Clermont Ferrand to Le Havre  France  In February 2003  a single Beluga performed the farthest distance charter flight ever  having flown for 25 hours  not including refueling stops  to transport two complete NHI NH90 helicopters along with a single Eurocopter Tiger attack helicopter from Marseille  France to Melbourne  Australia  for the Avalon Airshow', 'In 1999  a Beluga carried a large painting  Liberty Leading the People by Eug ne Delacroix  which had hung in the Louvre in Paris since 1874  It was flown from Paris to Tokyo via Bahrain and Kolkata in about 20 hours  The large canvas  measuring 2 99 metres  9 81 ft  high by 3 62 metres  11 88 ft  long  was too large to fit into a Boeing 747  It was transported in the vertical position inside a special pressurized container provided with isothermal protection and an anti vibration device', 'In 2004  a Beluga was used to deliver relief supplies to the Indian Ocean region following widespread devastation of coastal areas by a major tsunami  In 2005  the Beluga was employed to transport humanitarian aid and medical supplies from the United Kingdom and France to the Gulf Coast of the United States  in support of disaster relief operations in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina', 'The Beluga has seen recurrent use to transport bulky objects  including vehicles  for various different space programs  In 2001  sections of the unmanned Automated Transfer Vehicle  ATV  space vehicle were transported by a Beluga from Turin  Italy to Amsterdam  Netherlands  In 2004  multiple Beluga flights were made to Baikonur Cosmodrome  Kazakhstan  to deliver Astrium built satellites  In 2009  a Beluga was used to convey the Tranquility module of the International Space Station from Turin to Kennedy Space Center  United States']"
14,Airbus A318,"['The Airbus A318 is the smallest airliner in the Airbus A320 family  The A318 carries 107 to 132 passengers and has a maximum range of 5 700 km  3 100 nmi  Final assembly of the aircraft took place in Hamburg  Germany It is intended primarily for short range service  although British Airways uses the aircraft on a London City Airport to New York JFK Airport transatlantic route  albeit with a stopover in Shannon for refueling on the westbound leg  as it is too heavy to clear the short runway at LCY with a full load of fuel', 'The first member of the A320 aircraft family was the A320  which first flew on 22 February 1987 after the program was launched in March 1984  The family was soon extended to include the stretched A321  first delivery 1994  the shortened A319  first delivery 1996  and the further shortened A318  first delivery 2003  The A320 family pioneered the use in commercial aircraft of digital fly by wire flight control systems  as well as side stick controls', 'The Airbus A318 project had its origins in the collaboration among Chinese  Singaporean and European manufacturers  In May 1997  during the visit of French President Jacques Chirac to China  Aviation Industries of China  AVIC  Singapore Technologies Aerospace  STAe  Airbus and Alenia signed a framework agreement that outlined the development of aircraft in the 100 seat range  The AE31X programme  as it was tentatively dubbed  besides being a global industrial programme would have significantly deepened Sino European commercial ties 24 With development costs estimated to be upwards of  2 billion  AVIC would have a 46 percent stake in the project  STAe 15 percent  and Airbus Industrie Asia 39 percent  the latter of which comprised Airbus and Alenia 24 Final assembly would have taken place in China', 'The project never went past the exploratory phase 56 It comprised two clean sheet designs   the AE316 and the AE317  The AE316 would have had a length of 31 3 metres  102 ft 8 in  and the AE317  34 5 metres  113 ft 2 in   39 The standard versions of both variants had a maximum take off weight of 49 9 t  110 000 lb  for the smaller version and 54 2 t  119 000 lb  for the AE317  and would have been powered by either BMW Rolls Royce  CFM International  or Pratt   Whitney turbofan engines 39 Range was settled at 3 700 kilometres  2 000 nmi  for both standard variants  although there was a higher gross weight version which had greater range and engine power 39 The AE316 and AE317 would have seated a maximum of 105 and 125 passengers in five abreast seating  respectively  Both would share a flight deck and fly by wire flight control system similar to that of the A320 family', 'Market research conducted during 1997 revealed that airlines wanted a smaller aircraft in the 70 80 seat range  As the project proceeded  there were increasing disagreements between the Chinese side and Airbus  China wanted a larger aircraft than originally envisioned  In addition  there were difficulties arising out of negotiations about technology transfer and production workshare  and a weak business case 56 STAe  having previously expressed doubts about returns on the project  in 1998 withdrew from the project out of the failure between AIA and AVIC to reach an agreement  Airbus and AVIC would cancel the project in July that year  The A318 is believed to have emerged from the AE31X  though an Airbus only project  named the A319M5 in March 1998  began before the AE31X cancellation', 'During the design process  the A318 encountered several problems  The first one was the decline in demand for new aircraft following the September 11 attacks  Another was the new Pratt   Whitney turbofan engines  which burned more fuel than expected  By the time CFM International  CFM  had a more efficient engine ready for market  many A318 customers had already backed out  including Air China and British Airways  America West Airlines  which had selected the Pratt   Whitney engines  amended its A318 orders  opting instead for A319 or A320 aircraft  Trans World Airlines cancelled a significant order for fifty A318s after being acquired by American Airlines  which did not operate any A320 family aircraft at the time  although neither did TWA when the order was originally placed  While Airbus was hoping to market the A318 as a regional jet alternative  laws in both the U S  and Europe have kept it in the same class as larger aircraft for calculating charges such as landing fees  limiting the type s market potential', 'Orders for the A318 have been relatively slow  but slightly better than for its direct competitor the Boeing 737 600  At 30 September 2017  Airbus had received 80 orders for this  compared to 69 for the 737 600  The sales pace has been influenced by the strong sales of the Bombardier CRJ900 and Embraer E Jets series  The biggest A318 customers at 30 September 2017 were Governments  Executive and Private Jets  20  Air France  18  Avianca Holdings  15  GECAS  12  and Frontier Airlines  9', 'In September 2010  Airbus confirmed that from 2013 the Airbus A318 would become available with Sharklets  wingtip devices which reduce lift induced drag and improve efficiency through reduced fuel consumption  The optional devices  which will also be available on other Airbus A320 family models and are manufactured by Korean Air Aerospace Division  will increase the range of the aircraft to 5 930 kilometres  3 200 nmi    an increase of 185 kilometres  100 nmi  over a standard A318 with 107 seats in a two class configuration', 'The Airbus A318 is a small commercial  narrow body  single aisle  aircraft with a retractable tricycle landing gear and is powered by two wing pylon mounted turbofan engines  Two suppliers provide turbofan engines for the A318  CFM International with the CFM56 5B engine and Pratt   Whitney with the PW6000 engine  It is a low wing cantilever monoplane with a conventional tail unit having a single vertical stabilizer and rudder', 'Overall  the A318 is over six metres shorter and around 3 t  6 600 lb  lighter than the A320  To compensate for the reduced moment arm  it has a larger vertical stabiliser  While initial concepts depicted the aircraft with a Boeing 737 300 style dorsal fin extension  the final design incorporated a fin tip extension  making it 75 centimetres  30 in  taller than the other A320 variants  Pilots who are trained on the other variants may fly the A318 with no further certification  since it features a common flight deck and the same type rating as its sister aircraft  The A318 is also referred to as the A318', 'In March 2006  the European Aviation Safety Agency  EASA  certified a modified control software enhancement to the Airbus A318 designed to allow the aircraft to perform steep approaches  The aircraft is the largest commercial aircraft certified by EASA for steep approach operations  The software modifies the control laws of the aircraft when the steep approach function is selected by the crew  by automatically deploying some of the spoiler panels to provide additional drag when the aircraft is in the landing configuration  It also provides alternative aural alerts to the crew and modifies spoiler deployment automatically below 120 feet  37 m  on landing  The A318 steep approach procedure allows the aircraft to perform approaches at descent angles of up to 5 5  as opposed to the standard 3  for a normal approach', 'A test flight was conducted in May 2006 to prove the aircraft s steep approach and short runway performance by landing at London City Airport  where such steep approaches are required  The test flight also confirmed the aircraft s compatibility with the limited manoeuvring and parking space at that airport  Subsequently  in August  Airbus delivered the first A318 with steep approach capability to British Airways  which began operating the route the following month  eventually having two such aircraft capable of flights between London City Airport and John F  Kennedy International Airport in New York  On the westbound leg from London  a stopover is necessary for refueling  which occurs at Shannon Airport  Ireland because weight restrictions are necessary in order to take off within the existing short runway length of London City Airport  On the eastbound leg from New York this limitation is not present and the aircraft can take all the fuel needed for the transatlantic route to London  As of November 2017  only one aircraft is serving the route  operated in a 32 seat all business class configuration', 'Although final assembly of A320 family aircraft takes place in Toulouse  France  Hamburg  Germany  Tianjin  China  and Mobile  Alabama  USA  final assembly of the Airbus A318 was in Hamburg  Germany  The maiden flight of the Airbus A318 took place from Finkenwerder airfield in Hamburg on 15 January 2002  The first customer delivery was on 22 July 2003 to Frontier Airlines As of 30 September 2017  67 A318s remained in service with five airlines  in addition to governments  executive and private jets and undisclosed operators  Most A318 aircraft retired from airline service have been scrapped due to the engine and components being more valuable than whole aircraft  Frontier Airlines  the launch customer that acquired A318 aircraft between 2003 and
